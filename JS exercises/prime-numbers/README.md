## Instructions
A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1,
that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

1. Write a function that accepts a number and returns a boolean reflecting whether the input number is a prime or not.

2. Write a function that takes two numbers and returns an array of all prime numbers between that range. If you're not quite sure where to start, check out the Sieve of Eratosthenes, or the Sieve of Atkin on Wikipedia.
